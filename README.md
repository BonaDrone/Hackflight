Hackflight is simple, platform-independent, header-only C++ firmware for multirotor
[flight controllers](https://www.tindie.com/products/TleraCorp/ladybug-flight-controller/) 
and [simulators](https://github.com/simondlevy/HackflightSim).  It
is geared toward people like me who want to tinker with flight-control
firmware, and use it to teach students about ideas like inertial measurement
and PID tuning.  <b>If you are in the 99% percent of users who just want to get
your vehicle flying without getting into firmware hacking, I recommend
[Cleanflight](http://cleanflight.com/)</b> (great for getting started when
you're on a budget) <b>or the
[Ardupilot](http://copter.ardupilot.org) system</b> (for
sophisticated mission planning with waypoint navigation and the like).  In
addition to big user communities and loads of great features, these platforms
have safety mechanisms that Hackflight lacks, which will help avoid injury to
you and damage to your vehicle.

Although Hackflight is hardware/platform-independent, 
the hardware focus of the project has shifted to the Arduino-compatible, STM32L4-based 
boards from [Tlera Corp](https://www.tindie.com/stores/TleraCorp/): the
[Ladybug FC](https://www.tindie.com/products/TleraCorp/ladybug-flight-controller/)
brushed-motor board and the (currently in development) brushless-motor 
[ButterflyFC](https://github.com/simondlevy/Hackflight/wiki/B.01-Bill-of-Materials).
In addition to offering the full complement of i/o signals (UART, I<sup>2</sup>C,
SPI, digital, analog), these boards have hardware support for floating-point
operations, allowing us to write simpler code based on standard units:

* Quaternions in the interval [-1,+1]
* Euler angles in radians
* Accelerometer values in Gs
* Gyrometer values in radians per second
* Distances in meters, velocities in meters per second
* Axis demands (roll, pitch, yaw) in the interval [-1,+1]
* Throttle demand in [0,1]
* Motor demands in [0,1]

Hackflight
[firmware](https://github.com/simondlevy/hackflight/tree/master/src)
adheres to standard practices for C++, notably, short, simple methods and
minimal use of compiler macros like <b>#ifdef</b> that can make it difficult to
follow what the code is doing.  

Because a multirotor build typically involves choosing a flight-control board,
radio receiver, model (airframe), and PID control settings, Hackflight provides
a separate C++ class to support each of these components:
<ul>
<li> The <a href="https://github.com/simondlevy/Hackflight/blob/master/src/board.hpp">Board</a>
class specifies a set of three abstract (pure virtual) methods that you must
implement for a particular flight controller or simulator: getting the current
quaternion from the IMU; getting gyrometer rates from the IMU; and sending
commands to the motors.  <li> The <a
href="https://github.com/simondlevy/Hackflight/blob/master/src/receiver.hpp">Receiver</a>
class performs basic functions associated with R/C control (tracking stick
positions, checking switches) and specifies a set of abstract methods that you
implement for a particular receiver (reading channels values).  <li>The <a
href="https://github.com/simondlevy/Hackflight/blob/master/src/mixer.hpp">Mixer</a>
class is an abstract class that can be subclassed for various motor
configurations (QuadX, Hexacopter, Tricopter, etc.).  The <a
href="https://github.com/simondlevy/Hackflight/blob/master/src/mixers/quadx.hpp">QuadX</a>
subclass is already implemented.  
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/simondlevy/Hackflight/blob/master/src/stabilizer.hpp">Stabilizer</a>
class provides a constructor where you specify the stabilization PID values
appropriate for your model.  
</ul>

Because it is useful to get some visual feedback on things like vehicle orientation and RC receiver
channel values,  we also provide a very simple &ldquo;Ground Control Station&rdquo; (GCS) program.
that allows you to connect to the board and see what's going on. Windows users
can run this program directly: just download [this zipfile](http://home.wlu.edu/~levys/hackflight-gcs.zip),
unzip the file, open the folder, and double-click on <b>hackflight.exe</b>.
Others can run the <b>hackflight.py</b> Python script in the
<b>extras/gcs/python</b> folder.  To run the Python script you'll
need to install [MSPPG](https://github.com/simondlevy/hackflight/tree/master/extras/parser), a
parser generator for the Multiwii Serial Protocol (MSP) messages used by the
firmware. Follow the directions in that repository to install MSPPG for Python.
